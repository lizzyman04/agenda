## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Pre-Phase 1**: Use `isar_community` 3.3.2 — original `isar` package abandoned April 2023; API is drop-in compatible; all import paths use `package:isar_community/isar_community.dart`
- **Pre-Phase 1**: Add `infrastructure/` as sixth architectural layer between `data/` and `application/` — houses notification, backup, and app lock service implementations with Flutter/platform dependencies
- **Pre-Phase 1**: `@enumerated(EnumType.name)` is the project-wide convention for all Isar-persisted enums — prevents ordinal corruption on enum reordering
- **Pre-Phase 1**: Schema migration runner design — `schemaVersion` stored in SharedPreferences; migration blocks run inside `IsarService.open()`; `MigrationRunner` executes sequentially
- **Pre-Phase 1**: Notification ID strategy — deterministic derivation (e.g., `taskId * 10 + notificationType`); no separate ID registry; enables cancellation on delete/update and safe boot rescheduling
- **Pre-Phase 1**: Biometric unlock (DATA-06) is in v1 scope — `FlutterFragmentActivity` must replace `MainActivity` before any auth code is written
- **Pre-Phase 1**: Task search (TASK-11) is in v1 scope — Isar indexed field queries; index strategy finalized during Phase 2 schema design
- **Stack**: Flutter + isar_community + BLoC/Cubit + GetIt + injectable; minimum Flutter SDK 3.38.1
- **Architecture**: core/ → domain/ → data/ → infrastructure/ → application/ → presentation/ → config/; strict outer-depends-on-inner rule
- **Language**: All code/comments/enums in English; UI text in PT-BR by default with EN toggle
- **Phase 2**: EisenhowerQuadrant computed from isUrgent + isImportant flags at domain layer — not stored in Isar
- **Phase 2**: Soft delete via `deletedAt` field on ItemModel; 500-item query cap on active items
- **Phase 2**: `go_router` declared in pubspec but routing handled via `IndexedStack` + modal routes in Phase 2; go_router guard wired in Phase 5

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2 research flag**: OEM Android notification behavior (Samsung/Xiaomi/Huawei) varies significantly; consider a focused research spike before Phase 4 notification scheduling architecture is finalized
- **Phase 4 research flag**: PT-BR comma decimal separator in CSV round-trip (`1.234,56`) has edge cases; dedicate a spike to locale-aware parsing before the backup feature spec is written
- **Phase 5 research flag**: iOS `inactive` vs `paused` lifecycle states for lock triggering behave differently on simulator vs real device; spike recommended before Phase 5 app lock implementation
